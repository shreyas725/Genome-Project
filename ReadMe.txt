Sample project to find out pairwise relationships and correlation between chemicals, genes and protein marker datasets

Datasets and Files -
Here in this project, we have the following datasets as .csv files -

1) P_c_d - Dataset containing the pairwise correlation between chemicals and diseases respectively.

2) P_c_g - Dataset containing the pairwise correlation between chemicals and genes respectively.

3) P_d_c - Dataset containing the pairwise correlation between disease and chemicals respectively.

4) P_d_g - Dataset containing the pairwise correlation between disease and genes respectively.

5) P_g_c - Dataset containing the pairwise correlation between genes and chemicals respectively.

6) P_g_d - Dataset containing the pairwise correlation between genes and diseases respectively.

7) Preprocessed - Preprocessed text after word stemming and lemmatization.

8) Word_Correlation - Scripts and solutions to find the pairwise matching between chemicals, genes and diseases respectively.
